## [Unreleased]

### Added

- TXT and Markdown books have a full reader menu: Go to %, Auto Page Turn, reader options (font, size, line spacing, margins, orientation, alignment, anti-aliasing, and status bar), Dark Mode, Take Screenshot, Reading Stats, Mark Finished, Delete Book Stats, and Delete Book Cache.
- TXT and Markdown books now record reading stats, reading pace, and finished state like EPUB and XTC books.

### Fixed

- Delete Book Cache now works for Markdown (`.md`) books, and re-uploading a Markdown book clears its stale page index like it does for TXT books.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Hidden folders can be created using the web file manager now when prefixed with a dot.
- Choose whole numbers, one decimal, or two decimals for the book progress percentage in status bar settings.
- Two-finger Screen Rotation can be turned off in Settings > Controls > Taps & Gestures on multi-touch devices.
- Go to % and Go to Stable Page use a numeric keypad for typing an exact destination, including decimal percentages. Touch devices use the keypad exclusively; button-only devices keep the slider by default and hold Confirm/Select to switch to the keypad.

- Font menus and the web portal use a persistent catalog that loads one family's details at a time, preventing crashes with larger font collections.
- Web portal pages reuse browser-cached content after checking for firmware updates.
- Rapid queued EPUB page turns defer text anti-aliasing and image loading until the final page, making intermediate turns faster.
- Grayscale sleep screen images use the panel's direct grayscale waveform where supported, which folds the base frame into the grayscale pass instead of refreshing the screen separately first.

### Fixed

- The web EPUB optimizer now accepts books that use standard Adobe or IDPF font obfuscation, while leaving DRM-protected books unchanged.
- Frontlight schedule time pickers now use the compact number keypad from Go To screens.

- 9pt `Itty Bitty` reader font size, plus build flags for omitting Itty Bitty and Large reader font assets in size-constrained firmware variants.
- In-reader confirmation message when a shortcut turns tilt-to-turn on or off.

### Fixed

- WiFi and OPDS connection-flow edge cases: manual Settings connections now show the connected status before continuing, copied or corrupted saved-password files are rejected before use, OPDS retries show loading before requests, and large OPDS feeds fail safely under low memory instead of rebooting.
- Reader and Home UI polish issues, including landscape status-bar settings, missing Vietnamese labels, File Browser and Lyra Carousel icon alignment, cover thumbnail artifacts, and duplicate Home progress/stat loading.
- EPUB cache and low-memory handling now use stable cache folder keys, migrate older cache folders where possible, rebuild stale section caches, lay out very long text blocks earlier, stream table fallback content when heap is tight, and clarify the warning text.
- Sleep-entry, network, and SD-card font download reliability improvements: cached sleep-screen assets are reused, OPDS pages idle normally after load, the X3 tilt sensor sleeps outside the reader, WiFi power saving is disabled during transfers, WebDAV stack usage is lower, longer stalls are tolerated, interrupted font files are retried, and active reader fonts are freed when needed.
- Remaining reader service edge cases, including an XTC chapter selector crash on memory-constrained builds, SD-card font size selection, SD-card font-size shortcuts skipping manually installed sizes, and KOReader Sync login compatibility with self-hosted servers that return valid JSON on success.

### Changed

- Modified upstream "page-as-sleep" behavior into a new `Sleep Screen > Quick Resume` option, which also keeps `Quick Resume on Timeout` on, and renamed the timeout-only toggle.
- Improved reader and browser menu behavior by moving the Footnotes shortcut above Select Chapter, wrapping long book titles in action menus, and reducing progress-screen repaint work during OPDS and SD font downloads.

## [v1.2.11.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Removed Medium font size from `xlarge` build to get it below the size limit

### Fixed

- Lyra Carousel is now included by activating the build flag `DCROSSINK_ENABLE_LYRA_CAROUSEL=1`

---

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- New personal theme: "Minimal"
- Custom sleep timer picker so `Time to Sleep` can be set from 1 to 30 minutes instead of cycling fixed presets.
- In-reader Controls shortcut for customizing buttons without leaving the book.
- Bookmark cleanup shortcuts: hold Select on a bookmark to delete it, or hold Open on a book in Bookmarks to clear that book's bookmark list.
- Confirmation message after deleting a book's cache from the reader or File Browser.
- File Browser long-press action for deleting an EPUB or XTC book's cache.
- Downloaded-font size range setting so SD-card fonts can use compact, default, or large point-size sets.
- File Browser long-press action for marking EPUB books as finished or unfinished.

### Changed

- Hardened deep sleep entry by shutting WiFi down before waiting for the power button to be released.
- Raised the web file-transfer filename limit from 100 to 150 bytes so longer uploaded filenames are preserved.
- Made the in-reader Reader Options menu include the same Reader settings and actions as Settings > Reader.
- Split SD-card font descriptions and supported languages into separate lines in the font download screen.

### Fixed

- Inline EPUB images no longer disappear in landscape when their bottom edge slightly overlaps the screen margin.
- Reduced unnecessary low-memory image suppression for JPEG-heavy EPUB chapters and added CSS heap diagnostics during chapter rebuilds.
- Allowed wider inline JPEG images in EPUBs to render when they still fit the total pixel and heap safety limits.
- SD-card font picker no longer reopens immediately after selecting a font from Settings > Reader > Font Family.
- In-reader font-size changes now work for SD-card fonts.
- In-reader SD-card font changes now rebuild the current EPUB page layout consistently.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `Recent Books View` setting so the dedicated Recent Books screen can switch between the classic list and a 3x3 cover grid.
- More flexible reader controls, including orientation-aware front/side button settings, nav-only or all-button front inversion, tilt page turn shortcuts, and side-button long-press rotation actions.
- Per-session auto page turn interval picker with values from 5 to 120 seconds.
- File Browser Home/Back long-press action for toggling hidden files and folders.
- EPUB rendering and diagnostics improvements, including visible `<hr>` separators and heap logs around section rebuilds, image extraction, page serialization, and sleep-cache rebuilds.
- Reader font coverage for block redactions, black-square ornaments, Greek category letters, and turned-comma punctuation (PR #104).
- Simulator tools for testing sleep/wake behavior and smoke-testing common screens and EPUB reader menus.

### Changed

- Reduced Controls settings section spacing so the grouped controls fit better on X3 screens.
- Made front reader long-press actions trigger when the hold delay is reached while normal page turns still trigger on release.
- Used the fast EPUB spine/TOC indexing path for books with 300+ spine entries so heavily split books build `book.bin` faster on first open.
- Allowed the web file manager and WebDAV to browse dot-prefixed hidden files when hidden files are enabled, matching the device file browser.

### Fixed

- Reader button and shortcut behavior, including X3 power-button wake filtering, folder delete long-press timing, and WiFi scan/connect screens that could not be exited while work was in progress.
- RoundedRaff home-menu, keyboard, and button-hint rendering issues so Settings remains reachable and compact labels no longer overlap or disappear.
- Font and glyph handling now reduces persistent SD-card font advance-cache memory, releases optional font caches before image extraction only when heap is tight, and shows a visible replacement symbol when compact UI fonts lack `U+FFFD`.
- KOReader Sync authentication diagnostics and an in-reader sync crash, including clearer handling when a server or proxy returns non-JSON content.
- EPUB text rendering for redactions, whitespace-only XHTML text nodes, simple black CSS span backgrounds, list bullets in `<li><p>...</p></li>` items, and very long base64-like text runs.
- EPUB image, thumbnail, and section-rebuild stability so image-heavy chapters use less temporary memory, scale images more reliably, avoid stale dimensions, and suppress optional image work earlier under heap pressure.
- EPUB low-memory and cache safety now skips optional next-chapter indexing and sleep-page cache rebuilds when heap is tight, fails safely with a malformed-book warning and Home exit path, rebuilds incompatible fork-written caches, and handles low-memory CSS parsing, truncated SD writes, invalid serialized strings, and failed temp-cache promotion.
- Home no longer crashes after clearing reading cache when the source EPUB cache is missing.
- Reader prewarm behavior now skips image decoding, keeps mixed-style font glyphs cached together, and avoids section rebuilds for render-quality-only option changes.
- Concurrent render/storage crashes are avoided by serializing `GfxRenderer` scratch-buffer access, shared SPI bus access, and failed SPI lock cleanup.
- Recent Books, EPUB/XTC thumbnail caches, deleted-folder metadata, and XTC cover scaling now keep cached book data in sync and grid covers fill their slots correctly.
- Simulator build configuration now lets SDL2 and simulator-provided network/OTA shims compile cleanly.

---

## [v1.2.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Cleaned up EPUB table rendering by removing synthetic row/cell labels and defaulting table cells to readable left alignment
- Allow simple EPUB tables with full-width note rows so a single `colspan` cell spanning the whole table no longer forces the entire table back to paragraph fallback

### Fixed

- Power-button shortcut conflicts outside the reader so reader-only actions fall back to `Confirm` while Sleep, Refresh, Screenshot, Sync Progress, and File Transfer remain real power actions.
- Potential crash when using `Go to %` in EPUBs.
- Potential crash when entering sleep with Page Overlay enabled if the cached EPUB page data is invalid.
