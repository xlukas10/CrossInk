# Data Cache

CrossInk caches data aggressively on the SD card to minimize RAM use. The ESP32-C3 has about 380 KB of usable RAM, so rebuilding every book structure in memory on every open would be too expensive.

The main data directory is `.crosspoint` on the SD card. It stores render caches and persistent user/device data.

## Directory Layout

└── txt_12471232/           # TXT progress, page index, stats, speed reader state (reader_settings.bin), and cover
```

Four-tone sleep covers use separate `_absolute.bmp` files so older cover shading is not reused. These are generated on demand for supported displays; TXT/Markdown JPG covers also use a separate `cover_absolute.bmp`. Existing cover and thumbnail caches remain available, and no manual cache reset is needed.

## Clearing Cache Data

Deleting the entire `.crosspoint` directory resets caches, settings, saved network/server data, bookmarks, recent books, reading progress, and reading stats.

To clear EPUB/XTC render caches from the device UI without deleting settings or global stats, use:

**Settings > System > Files & Cache > Clear Reading Cache**

## Book Moves And Cache Identity

Cache folders are path-based. Moving a book file can create a new cache directory, so the moved copy may start with fresh reading progress unless the firmware migrates the cache for that move. CrossInk migrates cache and bookmark data for the built-in move-to-Read flow and related file-browser move actions.

EPUB reader font, page layout, styling, and reading-aid settings normally come from the global Reader settings. If those settings are changed from inside an EPUB, CrossInk stores a per-book override in that book's `reader_settings.bin`; books without that override continue to follow the global defaults. EPUB render mode is also stored per book so a problematic title can be switched to Balanced or Light rendering from the File Browser or Recent Books long-press menus before opening it.

EPUB clippings and highlights live outside the EPUB render-cache folder in
`/.crosspoint/clippings/`. Each book gets a binary clipping file named from the
book type and the CRC32 of the book path. The same clipping record powers the
in-reader highlight, the clipping list, and jump-back behavior. CrossInk also
appends a Kindle-style text export to `/My Clippings.txt` on the SD-card root;
that export is human-readable and append-only, so deleting a clipping in the UI
removes the in-app saved clipping but does not rewrite old text already exported
to `/My Clippings.txt`.

Cache data is cleared by supported CrossInk delete/move flows. If you remove or rename books outside CrossInk by editing the SD card directly, old cache folders may remain until you clear reading cache.

All-time reading stats can also be backed up outside `.crosspoint` in:

```text
/.crossink-stats-backup/
```
