# File Formats

These formats describe the SD-card cache files under `/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/`.
All POD fields are written in the ESP32 little-endian representation used by
`Serialization.h`; strings are length-prefixed UTF-8 unless a format notes a
fixed-size char buffer.

## `/.crosspoint/sleep-image-index/<directory-hash>-{bmp,all}.idx`

### Version 1

`ImageFolderIndex` (`src/activities/boot_sleep/ImageFolderIndex.{h,cpp}`) keeps
a compact, rebuildable index per indexed folder. It backs both the sleep-image
folder and the boot-screen folder (`/bootscreen` or `/.bootscreen`); the
directory name predates the boot-screen use and was kept as-is so existing
sleep caches aren't orphaned by an unrelated rename. The index avoids walking
a folder on every selection while using only one fixed-size record at a time
in RAM. `bmp` contains BMP files and `all` contains BMP and PNG files (sleep's
Page Overlay mode only; the boot screen is BMP-only and always uses a `bmp`
index). The `validated` header flag means BMP headers were checked while
rebuilding after a failed render.

The index is disposable: a missing, malformed, or stale selected entry causes
one rebuild and then the caller falls back to its directory scan. File
transfer, file-browser, and preferred-folder changes invalidate affected
indexes via `ImageFolderIndex::invalidateForPath()`. Files added or changed
directly on the SD card have no notification path; they are picked up when a
cached entry is found missing or when an index is otherwise rebuilt.

```c++
struct ImageFolderIndexHeader {
    char magic[4];       // "CSIX"
    u8 version;          // 1
    u8 flags;            // bit 0: BMP+PNG, bit 1: BMP headers validated
    u16 pathLength;
    u16 recordCount;
    u16 recordSize;      // sizeof(ImageFolderIndexRecord)
    u32 recordsOffset;   // sizeof(header) + pathLength
    char directory[pathLength];
};

struct ImageFolderIndexRecord {
    u16 nameLength;
    u8 flags;             // bit 0: PNG (otherwise BMP)
    u8 reserved;
    char name[256];      // zero-padded UTF-8 filename, max 255 bytes
};
```

## `book.bin`

### Version 9

`book.bin` stores EPUB metadata plus lookup tables for spine and TOC entries.
The current firmware writes this version from `BookMetadataCache`.
Version 9 stores book and TOC title strings NFC-composed so decomposed
diacritics render correctly with device fonts. It also rebuilds metadata after
the EPUB guide start-reference handling changed.

}
```

## `reader_settings.bin`

### Version 11

Each EPUB cache directory may contain `reader_settings.bin`. Missing files mean
the book uses global Reader settings, the default auto-page-turn interval, and
the default speed reader settings.

Version 1 stored only:

- `u8 version`
- `u16 autoPageTurnSeconds`

Version 2 stores flags before the full reader-settings snapshot. Version 3 adds
the EPUB word-spacing level to that snapshot. Version 4 adds the EPUB indexing
method (`0` = incremental, `1` = full section). Version 5 appends a per-book
dictionary SD-font family name. Version 6 stores reader font sizes as physical
point sizes, version 7 appends the dictionary font's selected point size, and
version 8 splits the screen margin into vertical and horizontal values. Version
9 removes the obsolete per-book Dark Mode byte: Dark Mode is now a global
display setting. Version 10 appends the per-book speed reader state (on/off,
words per group, and display interval). Speed reader values are meaningful only
when flag bit 4 is set; otherwise the book uses the defaults (off, 1 word,
0.3 s). Version 11 appends the speed reader Guide Dots switch (default off).
Firmware that only knows version 9 ignores a version 10 or 11 file and falls
back to global settings for that book.
This lets the
file preserve an auto-page-turn interval without forcing custom font/layout
settings for the book. It also stores a per-book EPUB render mode override,
which can be changed from book action menus before opening the book so a
problematic EPUB can be moved to Balanced or Light rendering without entering
the reader first. Safe Mode also uses this file to save Light rendering with
embedded styles, Focus Reading, and Guide Dots disabled after that final
fallback successfully opens a difficult book.

```c++
struct ReaderSettingsBin {
    u8 version; // 11
    u8 flags;   // bit 0 = custom reader settings, bit 1 = custom auto-page-turn interval, bit 2 = render mode override, bit 3 = dictionary font override, bit 4 = speed reader settings
    u16 autoPageTurnSeconds;
    u8 renderMode; // 0 = CrossInk Default, 1 = Balanced, 2 = Light

    u8 fontFamily;
    u8 readerFontPointSize; // physical point size; versions 2-5 stored a size slot
    u8 lineHeightPercent;
    u8 wordSpacing; // 0 = natural font spacing; 1-4 widen each gap by ~75% per level
    u8 orientation;
    u8 screenMarginVertical;
    u8 screenMarginHorizontal;
    u8 publisherPageNumbers;
    u8 paragraphAlignment;
    u8 embeddedStyle;
    u8 hyphenationEnabled;
    u8 textAntiAliasing;
    u8 imageRendering;
    u8 extraParagraphSpacing;
    u8 forceParagraphIndents;
    u8 focusReadingEnabled;
    u8 guideReadingEnabled;
    u8 snapshotRenderMode;
    u8 indexingMethod; // 0 = incremental, 1 = full section
    char sdFontFamilyName[64];
    char dictionarySdFontFamilyName[64]; // meaningful only when flag bit 3 is set
    u8 dictionaryFontPointSize; // 0 = follow reader size
    u8 speedReaderEnabled;      // version 10+; meaningful only when flag bit 4 is set
    u8 speedReaderWordsPerGroup; // 1-10
    u16 speedReaderIntervalTenths; // 1-100, tenths of a second each word group is shown
    u8 speedReaderGuideDots;       // version 11+; 1 = dot between the words of a group
};
```

## TXT `reader_settings.bin`

### Version 2

TXT and Markdown cache directories (`txt_<hash>`) may contain their own, much
smaller `reader_settings.bin` with per-book state. TXT books have no per-book
font or layout overrides, so the file currently holds only the speed reader
state. A missing file, an unknown version, or a truncated file means the book
uses the speed reader defaults (off, 1 word, 0.3 s, no Guide Dots). The file is
kept when the book cache is deleted or the book is re-uploaded. Version 1 had no
`speedReaderGuideDots` byte and still loads.

```c++
struct TxtReaderSettingsBin {
    u8 version; // 2
    u8 flags;   // bit 0 = speed reader settings
    u8 speedReaderEnabled;
    u8 speedReaderWordsPerGroup;   // 1-10
    u16 speedReaderIntervalTenths; // 1-100, tenths of a second
    u8 speedReaderGuideDots;       // version 2+
};
```

## `/.crosspoint/clippings/<bookType>_<crc32(path)>.bin`

### Versions 1-4

Clipping files store the per-book EPUB clipping list used by the reader. A
saved clipping is also what CrossInk renders as an in-reader highlight; there is
no separate highlight file. The file lives in `/.crosspoint/clippings/` instead
of the EPUB render-cache directory so clearing/rebuilding layout cache does not
delete user clippings.

The current implementation only writes EPUB clipping files, so `bookType` is
`epub`. The numeric suffix is `uzlib_crc32()` of the book's SD-card path, for
example:

```text
/.crosspoint/clippings/epub_1234567890.bin
```

Binary layout:

- `[0]` version (`1`, `2`, `3`, or current version `4`)
- `[1-2]` clipping count (`uint16_t` LE, maximum `256`)
- book title (`String`)
- book author (`String`)
- book path (`String`)
- repeated clipping records:
  - `spineIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `startPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `endPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `pageCount` (`uint16_t` LE, at least `1`)
  - `startWordIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `endWordIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `wordCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `paragraphIndex` (`uint16_t` LE, `UINT16_MAX` when unavailable)
  - `timestamp` (`uint32_t` LE, seconds since firmware boot when saved)
  - versions 3-4: reader layout signature (`uint32_t` LE; font, spacing,
    viewport, and other section-layout inputs)
  - version 4: table selection (`uint16_t` LE; `UINT16_MAX` for non-table text)
  - `chapterTitle` (`char[48]`, null-terminated/truncated)
  - version 1: selected text (`String`; legacy files were written with a
    `512`-byte in-app limit)
  - versions 2-4: selected-text length (`uint16_t` LE) followed by that many
    UTF-8 bytes (the current in-app limit is `4096` bytes, defined by
    `CLIPPING_TEXT_MAX`)

The clipping selector has a separate navigation bound: it exposes at most
`240` visible words from at most three pages. This is a bounded in-memory
selection window for low-memory devices, not a character-count limit. The
selected text is still stored separately and is limited to `4096` UTF-8 bytes.

CrossInk uses the stored spine/page/paragraph fields as anchors, then searches
near that location for the stored clipping text after relayout. This is similar
to keeping both a DOM position and a text quote in a web app: the numeric
position gives a fast starting point, while the text makes jumps and highlights
survive font, layout, or page-count changes when possible.

Version 3 records which reader layout produced the numeric page/word anchor.
When that signature differs, CrossInk ignores the stale numeric range and
matches the saved text instead, including when both layouts happen to have the
same total page count. Legacy records without a layout signature use text
matching rather than trusting ambiguous numeric ranges. Version 4 adds the
table selection field; versions 1-3 remain readable.

Creating a clipping also appends a Kindle-style export entry to
`/My Clippings.txt` on the SD-card root. That text export can keep up to `2000`
bytes of the selected text and is append-only. Removing a clipping from the
reader deletes or rewrites only the binary clipping file; it does not remove
previous entries from `/My Clippings.txt`.

When CrossInk moves an EPUB through its built-in move-to-Read flow, it rewrites
the clipping file under the new path-derived name and removes the old one. If a
book is renamed or moved outside CrossInk, the path hash changes, so the old
clipping file may no longer be associated with the book until the file is moved
back or the clipping store is migrated.

## `stats_v5.bin`

### Version 5

`stats_v5.bin` stores per-book reading statistics for stats schema version 5.
Versioned filenames let firmware branches with different stats schemas keep
their own per-book stats files without overwriting each other. Version 5 extends
version 4 with a cached live reader book time-left estimate so Home and Reading
Stats can show the same estimate the reader last computed.

When `stats_v5.bin` is missing, CrossInk can read the previous versioned stats
filename (`stats_v4.bin` for version 5, `stats_v5.bin` after a future version 6
bump) before falling back to legacy `stats.bin` files with compatible stats
payloads. Future changes are always saved to the current versioned filename.

Binary layout:

- `[0]` version (`5`)
- `[1-2]` `sessionCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[3-6]` `totalReadingSeconds` (`uint32_t` LE)
- `[7-10]` `totalPagesTurned` (`uint32_t` LE)
- `[11]` `isCompleted` (`uint8_t`)
- `[12-13]` `avgSecondsPerForwardPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[14-15]` `paceSampleCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[16]` flags (`bit0=startDateManual`, `bit1=finishedDateManual`)
- `[17-20]` `startDate` (`year uint16_t` LE, `month uint8_t`, `day uint8_t`)
- `[21-24]` `finishedDate` (`year uint16_t` LE, `month uint8_t`, `day uint8_t`)
- `[25-40]` `timeOfDaySeconds[4]` (`uint32_t` LE each)
- `[41-68]` `dayOfWeekSeconds[7]` (`uint32_t` LE each)
- `[69-72]` `estimatedTimeLeftSeconds` (`uint32_t` LE, `0` means unavailable)

## `section.bin`

### Version 78

Version 78 appends one byte to every serialized `TextBlock`, after its
`BlockStyle`: `endsParagraph` (`0` or `1`). It is `1` on the last line of a
laid-out paragraph, including lines ended by `<br>` or another block break, and
lets the speed reader end word groups at paragraph ends. Page rendering ignores
it. Complete files use byte `78`; suspended partials use the previously unused
sentinel `0xF2`. Older full and partial layouts rebuild automatically.

### Version 77

Version 77 keeps the serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped because ordered
lists now number their items, `list-style-type: none` suppresses markers, and
`<ul>`/`<ol>` margins and padding contribute to child insets. Complete files use
byte `77`; suspended partials use the previously unused sentinel `0xF3`.
The related CSS rule cache uses version `18`; version `17` already occurs in
local branch history.

### Version 75

Version 75 keeps the serialized layout unchanged but excludes EPUB elements with
the HTML `hidden` attribute. Complete files use byte `75`; suspended partials use
`0xF4`. Both older full and partial layouts rebuild automatically.
Versions 67–74 and partial sentinel 0xF5 already occur in other local branch
history; using fresh identifiers avoids accepting those experimental caches.

### Version 66

Version 66 keeps the version 63 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because internal EPUB links now preserve CSS superscript and subscript styles,
changing their cached word-style flags and page layout. Complete files use
version byte `66`, and suspended partials use sentinel byte `0xF6`.

The stable v1.5.1 release retains these identifiers from RC6. Do not normalize
published RC versions to the previous stable version plus one: v1.5.0 used
`60` / `0xF9`, and RC4 already shipped `61` / `0xF8` with older layout output.
Reusing those identifiers could accept stale RC caches as current. Per-book
reader settings likewise retain version `9` and their version 7/8 migrations.

### Version 62

Version 62 stores one compact source-whitespace bit per word in serialized text
blocks. Touch reader previews use it to reflow words with the selected font
without inferring spaces from device-specific pixel advances. Full and
suspended section caches rebuild together; complete files use version byte
`62`, and suspended partials use sentinel byte `0xF8`.

### Version 61

Version 61 was an earlier v1.5.1 release-candidate cache update. It stores `protectedImageUnits`
(`uint32_t` LE) after `pageCount`, so image-heavy sections estimate their
remaining non-image pages accurately. It also updates table fragments and
geometry, oversized-word wrapping, inline-image margins, and ruby continuation
layout. Full and suspended section caches rebuild together; complete files use
version byte `61`, and suspended partials use sentinel byte `0xF8`.

Each file in `sections/*.bin` stores one laid-out spine section. The header is
also the cache-busting key: if any layout-affecting setting differs from the
current reader settings, the section is discarded and rebuilt.

Version 59 adds a compact page-start visible-text-offset lookup table. The
offset is a Unicode codepoint coordinate in the spine XHTML, so reader progress
and KOReader sync can return to the same content after a font, orientation, or
indexing-method change instead of relying on a page percentage. Suspended
incremental caches store the same table for their readable prefix; a target
beyond that prefix must continue indexing before it can be resolved.

Version 57 is binary-identical to version 56. The version was bumped because
word-gap suppression now applies only to tokens glued together in the source.
Older caches could collapse explicit spaces between Hangul words, so full and
suspended partial section caches rebuild together. Version 58 recalculates
Focus Reading split-run offsets with the renderer's combined advance and
kerning rounding, so old cached page positions rebuild.

Version 56 changes `<br>` layout: a line break after text no longer reapplies
the containing block's top or bottom spacing, while an empty `<br>` block keeps
the existing scene-break gap. Full and suspended partial section caches rebuild
together. Version 55 assigns compact IDs to internal EPUB links. The ID is
stored in the existing per-word flags byte and in each page's footnote entry so
touch devices can map tapped text to the existing fragment-navigation path
without retaining another per-word data structure. Version 54 adds compact
ruby-text annotations to serialized text blocks. Only words that begin a ruby
group store annotation text; continuation words use a dedicated style bit. This
keeps books without ruby markup unchanged apart from the cache version while
avoiding an empty string allocation for every word.
Version 53 stores each image's EPUB-internal source path so section indexing can
read only its header and defer full extraction until the page is shown. Version
52 keeps Guide Dots centered when extra word spacing is enabled. Version 51
preserves continuation state for oversized CJK word fragments. Version 50
paginates chapter-heading image runs within the reader viewport so they do not
overflow into the reserved status-bar area. Version 49 stores Focus Reading
split-run offsets in visual order so RTL word prefixes render on the right.
Version 48 changed Arabic contextual shaping and text measurement, so cached
word positions from version 47 no longer match what `drawText` renders.

Version 48 makes the EPUB word-spacing level widen the natural inter-word gap
(each level adds 10 pixels), which changes laid-out word positions, so
older sections must rebuild. Version 46 added the EPUB word-spacing level to the
cache-busting header. It retains the flat `TextBlock` arena and chapter-opener
anchor behavior introduced in version 45. It includes:

- cache-busting fields for font, line compression, extra paragraph spacing,
  forced paragraph indents, paragraph alignment, viewport size, hyphenation,
  embedded CSS, image rendering mode, Focus Reading, Guide Dots, word spacing,
  and EPUB render mode
- page offset LUT
- anchor-to-page map for fragment and footnote navigation
- paragraph and list-item LUTs used by KOReader sync page refinement
- visible-text-offset LUT used to resolve page positions across reflow and sync
- optional per-word Focus Reading split metadata
- optional per-word Guide Dot x-offset metadata
- optional per-word text flags for CSS backgrounds, layout-inserted hyphens,
  and internal-link IDs
- reading-aid layout that stores Focus Reading and Guide Dots as per-word metadata instead of temporary layout words
- publisher CSS page-break handling and adjusted justification spacing baked into page layout
- table fragments
- per-page footnote entries
- per-page publisher page markers
- serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and
  subscript
- flat TextBlock word storage: per-word arrays plus one shared NUL-terminated
  text blob, replacing length-prefixed word strings and parallel vectors. The
  on-disk order mirrors the in-RAM arena so the firmware reads a whole block
  payload with a single allocation and a single SD read

## Optimizer image transport (PXC2 and COIX)

Optimizer images are optional EPUB sidecars. Original JPEG/PNG assets remain the
compatibility fallback. `META-INF/crossink/optimizer-v1.json`,
`META-INF/crossink/optimizer-images-v1.idx`, and all
`META-INF/crossink/pxc/*.pxc2` entries must use ZIP STORE. PXC2 has its own block
compression; the firmware rejects ZIP-deflated PXC2 before starting an inflater.
The manifest keeps `format: "crossink-optimizer"` and `version: 1`. Each image has
`href`, `pxc`, `width`, `height`, `pxcFormat: "pxc2"`, `pxcBytes` (complete transport
size), and `pixelCrc32`. Missing `pxcFormat` means legacy raw PXC1.

All integers below are unsigned little endian. Fields are serialized explicitly,
not by writing native C++ structures. CRCs use standard IEEE CRC32 (zlib).

### PXC2

The 32-byte header is:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | `PXC2` |
| 4 | 1 | Version 2 |
| 5 | 1 | Pixel format 1: four 2-bit pixels per byte, most significant first |
| 6 | 2 | Header bytes: 32 |
| 8 | 2 | Width |
| 10 | 2 | Height |
| 12 | 2 | Row bytes: `(width + 3) / 4` |
| 14 | 2 | Block bytes: 2048 |
| 16 | 2 | Block count: ceiling of raw bytes / 2048 |
| 18 | 2 | Flags: zero |
| 20 | 4 | Raw pixel bytes |
| 24 | 4 | Raw pixel CRC32 |
| 28 | 4 | Complete PXC2 file bytes |

Dimensions are 1–1024, raw data is at most 128 KiB, and there are at most 64
blocks. Each block starts with a 12-byte header: codec (`u8`, 0 RAW, 1 raw DEFLATE,
2 PackBits), zero flags (`u8`), raw length (`u16`), encoded length (`u16`), sequence
(`u16`, starting at zero), decoded-block CRC32 (`u32`). Lengths are 1–2048. All
non-final blocks have 2048 raw bytes. Compressed blocks must be smaller than raw;
otherwise producers use RAW. Every block is independent. PackBits controls 0–127
copy the next control+1 bytes; 129–255 repeat the next byte 257-control times;
128 is rejected. Raw DEFLATE must terminate exactly, with no extra input/output.
Python uses zlib level 8 and `wbits=-15`; the browser uses PackBits/RAW.

The reader reuses a fallibly allocated session workspace (5928 bytes on the
64-bit host; firmware size is compile-time limited below 6500), verifies all
lengths/CRCs and resizes rows into `img_*.pxc.optimizer.tmp`. It checks size and
syncs/closes before publishing. On filesystems that cannot rename over an existing
file, `.optimizer.previous` retains the previous cache until publication succeeds;
failed rollback leaves that backup available for recovery on the next attempt. PXC2 never needs a full raw source temporary file.
The local raw PXC layout remains two `u16` dimensions plus packed rows. No section
cache version change is required. Hardware heap and visual results remain device
acceptance checks, not implied by host workspace accounting.

### COIX version 1

The local index is `/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/optimizer-images.idx`. Its header is:

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | `COIX` |
| 4 | 2 | Version 1 |
| 6 | 2 | Header bytes: 32 |
| 8 | 2 | Record bytes: 208 |
| 10 | 2 | Record count: 0–256 |
| 12 | 4 | Flags/reserved: zero |
| 16 | 4 | Manifest central-directory CRC32 |
| 20 | 4 | Manifest uncompressed bytes |
| 24 | 4 | CRC32 of all records |
| 28 | 4 | CRC32 of header bytes 0–27 |

Each 208-byte record contains NUL-terminated `href[129]` (offset 0),
`pxcHref[65]` (129), width `u16` (194), height `u16` (196), format `u8` (198,
1 legacy or 2 PXC2), zero flags `u8` (199), complete sidecar bytes `u32` (200),
and pixel CRC32 `u32` (204). Paths are relative, bounded UTF-8; traversal,
backslashes, control characters, colons and percent escapes are rejected.
Sidecars must be beneath `META-INF/crossink/pxc/`. Duplicate image hrefs are invalid;
producers keep one optional sidecar per href and omit unsupported/over-limit
entries. Firmware can resize that sidecar for other layouts.

Reader setup validates a packaged index and copies it through a temporary local
file, or builds it from a legacy manifest while the framebuffer is loaned. Generic
`Epub::load()` does not build indexes. A lookup scans records on SD and retains
only one last hit. Manifest identity changes invalidate the local index. Per-page
preflight reuses local pixels first, then materializes just that page's sidecars,
then extracts original assets as fallback. Legacy ZIP inflation also runs under
the framebuffer loan. Sleep-page generation uses the same preflight. Temporary
index files are cleaned during setup and per-image temporaries during preflight.

Hardware acceptance: clear only the test book's cache, open legacy/PXC2 variants
with SD font and AA, visit/revisit image pages and sleep, compare portrait and
landscape output, and record internal free/largest heap blocks and low-water
marks. Repeat corrupt sidecars, full/read-only SD, interrupted writes and book
replacement at the same path on X3/X4, Sticky (SPI SD) and X4 Pro (SDMMC).

### CSS rules cache revision 18

Revision 18 adds the serialized `list-style-type` property used to number
ordered lists and suppress list markers. It also includes the PSRAM streamed
stylesheet path introduced in revision 16, which admits sources up to 512 KiB
on PSRAM readers while C3 retains its 128 KiB limit. Existing rule-count and
internal-memory guards still apply. Rebuilding an invalid CSS cache also
invalidates section caches through the existing EPUB-load path, so books that
previously cached zero rules can restore hidden content and layout rules.

## `/.crosspoint/font-catalog.bin`

### Version 1

Disposable font metadata cache, shared by reader, settings and web font controls.
The 24-byte little-endian header contains magic `0x46434931`, version, a 64-bit
inventory fingerprint, family count (maximum 128), and a reserved zero field.
It is followed by 152-byte family summaries: a NUL-terminated 128-byte name,
32-bit detail offset/byte count/FNV-1a hash, 16-bit file count, minimum/maximum
point sizes, four reserved zero bytes, and a 32-bit FNV-1a
checksum of the preceding summary bytes. Detail blocks follow the summaries.
Each detail is three bytes (point size, style, path length) followed by the
UTF-8 path bytes. Paths are at most 255 bytes; families contain at most 256
files. The whole cache is capped at 2 MiB.

Names/range labels load without retaining file paths. Only a requested family
hydrates its detail vector. Missing, incompatible or malformed summaries rebuild
the catalog by scanning names first and writing one family's paths at a time;
invalid detail blocks invalidate the cache for the next request.
Temporary memory failures preserve the font selection and cache for retry.
Writers finish and sync `font-catalog.tmp` before replacing the cache. An
interrupted replacement is safe because no user data is stored here.

On first font metadata access after boot or explicit invalidation, an inventory
walk checks names, directory kinds and file lengths in both font roots and their
immediate subdirectories. It reads no font contents on an index hit, and is not
repeated when catalog RAM is released and reloaded during the same session. This
detects externally added/removed files and changed lengths after restarting;
same-length content-only edits outside the firmware are not detectable by that
check. Firmware upload/delete/move/download paths invalidate explicitly,
including failed dedicated font uploads; USB Drive invalidates before handing
the card to the host. Manage Fonts performs a full rescan; alternatively remove
this cache to force reinspection after external same-length font changes.

EPUB layout cache versions and identities are unchanged by this catalog.
