> **This is an unofficial fork of [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk)** that adds a speed reader and a much more capable TXT/Markdown reader. It is not affiliated with CrossInk or CrossPoint Reader; everything below the line comes from the original CrossInk README.

## What this fork adds

- **Speed reader** for EPUB, TXT, and Markdown books. It shows 1-10 words at a time in the middle of the screen for 0.1-10 seconds each. Groups end at paragraph ends, and EPUB books continue into the next chapter on their own.
  - Next Page starts and pauses. Previous Page steps back one group; hold it to go back faster.
  - Settings are remembered per book, including an optional Guide Dots switch, and the book menu shows ON/OFF next to it.
- **Full TXT/Markdown reader menu**: Go to %, Auto Page Turn, Speed Reader, reader options (font, size, line spacing, margins, orientation, alignment, anti-aliasing, status bar, Guide Dots), Dark Mode, screenshot, reading stats, Mark Finished, and delete stats/cache.
- **Reading stats for TXT/Markdown books**: reading time, reading pace, pages turned, and finished state, like EPUB and XTC books.
- **Guide Dots on TXT/Markdown pages**, using the same dots as EPUB.

See [Speed Reader](./docs/reader-features.md#speed-reader) and [TXT and Markdown Reader Menu](./docs/reader-features.md#txt-and-markdown-reader-menu) for details, and the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for everything added so far.

### Installing this fork

Download the `firmware-*.bin` from [this fork's releases page](https://github.com/xlukas10/CrossInk/releases) and flash it as described in [Installation](./docs/installation.md). Only the Xteink X3/X4 build is published for now.

On first open after installing, each EPUB lays out its chapters again once: the layout cache format changed.

### Supported Devices

- Xteink X3
- Xteink X4
- Xteink X4 Pro
- Xteink X4 Classic

## What's different in this fork

My goal with this fork was to maintain the core Crosspoint firmware while integrating my preferred typography and some lightweight reading statistics. I’ve focused on keeping the underlying system stable while layering in a few "nice-to-have" features and UI refinements along the way.

- Added ~~strikethrough~~ support.
- Made <u>underlines</u> thicker for better visibility.
- Added support for `<hr>` section breaks.
- Added support for "redaction" style rendering.
- Added improved support for tables with simple markup.
- Added ability to add bookmarks.
- Added ability to remap front buttons that only applies in the reader.
- Added Focus Reading and Guide Dots as optional reader modes.
- Added Force Paragraph Indents for books that render as one giant wall of text.
- Added ability to pin a sleep image as a favorite. The favorited image will always be displayed when your sleep settings are set to `Custom` or `Cover + Custom` (when no cover is available).
- Added more in-reader control remapping options for side buttons, short power button clicks, and long-press menu actions, and more.
- Added ability to mark a book as finished from the in-book menu. A pop-up will also display once 99% of the book is reached. This status allows tracking of total books read.
- Added ability to move finished books to "Read" folder.
- In-book menu to quickly adjust reader options without having to exit the book.
- Reading stats: total books read, total reading time, number of sessions, pages turned, average session time, pages turned per minute. You can also set your reading stats as your sleep screen.
- All-time reading stats [syncing](./docs/reading-stats-sync.md) between two CrossInk devices.
- Reading [progress sync](./docs/nearby-position-sync.md) between two CrossInk devices.
- Added customizable Auto Page Turn Interval (anything between 5-120 seconds).
- Added ability to view Recent Books as a 3x3 grid view.
- To view a more detailed list for each version, visit the [releases](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/releases) page to read release notes.

### Reader Fonts

The default fonts have been replaced with Lexend Deca and Bitter. These fonts have been chosen specifically to improve reading fluency and e-ink performance. These 'sturdier' typefaces feature uniform stroke weights and open geometries, allowing the X4/X3 to render crisp, high-contrast text with font-aliasing on while significantly reducing ghosting and artifacts.

- [Lexend Deca](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca) - A research-backed sans-serif typeface designed to improve reading fluency. Lexend was engineered based on the theory that reading issues are often a design problem (visual crowding) rather than a cognitive one.
- [Bitter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter) - A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on digital screens. The consistent stroke weight of Bitter helps it render particularly well on e-ink devices. The medium weight has been chosen specifically for improved rendering on the X4/X3.

The UI now uses [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as the display font which has improved readability at smaller sizes.

### Music and Supplemental Glyphs

- Built-in reader fonts include music notation, selected Cyrillic glyphs, and the Project Hail Mary CJK fallback ranges. Additional SD-card fonts retain emoji fallback support.

---

### Font Sizes

CrossInk includes 10 pt, 12 pt, 14 pt, and 16 pt built-in reader font sizes.

See [SD Card Fonts](./docs/sd-card-fonts.md) for installing additional font families and size ranges.

---

### Reader features

Reader Options, Focus Reading, Guide Dots, Force Paragraph Indents, reading stats, and finished-book behavior are documented in [Reader Features](./docs/reader-features.md).

### Custom button actions

CrossInk adds configurable button shortcuts.

See [Controls](./docs/controls.md) for the full action list and defaults.

## Tips for the best reading experience

CrossInk runs on an ESP32-C3 with limited RAM, so very large folders or complex EPUBs can be slower than they would be on a phone, tablet, or desktop app.

- Keep folders under about 200 files. For the smoothest browsing, aim for 50-100 files per folder.
- Having 1000+ books on the SD card is fine if they are split into smaller folders, such as by author, series, genre, or read/unread status.
- Avoid putting every book in the SD card root. The file browser has to scan and sort the current folder before it can show it.
- Text-first EPUBs are the best fit. Large image-heavy EPUBs, scanned books, comics, and omnibus files with thousands of sections may load slowly or fail under memory pressure.
- As a rough target, EPUBs under 20 MB tend to work the best. Files over 50 MB may still work, but they are more likely to be slow or memory-sensitive, especially if they contain many large images.
- If an EPUB is unusually slow, try [optimizing](./docs/webserver.md#epub-optimization) it with the built-in web optimizer (via File Transfer) before copying it to the SD card: remove unused high-resolution images, split very large omnibus files, and avoid embedding multiple full font families when possible.
- Use a reliable SD card and leave some free space. CrossInk stores settings, reading progress, cache files, stats, and generated book data on the card.

## Development quick start

CrossInk uses PlatformIO for building and flashing firmware. See [Getting Started](./docs/development/getting-started.md) for prerequisites, clone setup, and validation commands.

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

Connect your device to your computer via a USB cable. Before the first build, initialize the repository's submodules (including `freeink-sdk`):

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then flash the firmware using the correct environment for the device. The `default` environment is for the X3/X4 devices. ESP32-S3 devices have their own named environments.

```sh
pio run -e default --target upload
```

If PlatformIO reports `PackageException: Can not create a symbolic link for freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BatteryMonitor, not a directory`, the `freeink-sdk` submodule is not initialized. Run the submodule command above and retry.

See [Testing and Debugging](./docs/development/testing-debugging.md) for serial logging, simulator checks, static analysis, and bug-report guidance.
